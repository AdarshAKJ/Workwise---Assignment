## How to Run the Code

### Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the repository by running:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AdarshAKJ/Workwise---Assignment.git
   ```

3. Navigate into the cloned repository folder:

   ```
   cd Workwise---Assignment
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd client
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. Open a new terminal.
2. Navigate into the cloned repository folder:

   ```
   cd Workwise---Assignment
   ```
3. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```
   cd api
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the backend server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

Now your application should be up and running with both the frontend and backend servers. Access the frontend on your local browser, usually at http://localhost:3000. Make sure both servers are running in their respective terminals.
